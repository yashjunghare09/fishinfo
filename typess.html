        <h2>Overview of Fish Types</h2>
        <p>Fish are a vital component of aquatic ecosystems, with a vast diversity that spans many habitats and ecological niches. Hereâ€™s a closer look at the main types of fish.</p>

        <div class="fish-type">
            <h3>Bony Fish (Osteichthyes)</h3>
            <p>Bony fish represent the largest class of fish, characterized by a skeleton made of bone. They are adaptable and can be found in both freshwater and saltwater.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Trout:</strong> Known for their beautiful coloration and preference for cold waters, trout are popular among anglers.</li>
                <li><strong>Goldfish:</strong> A domesticated species often kept in aquariums, known for their vibrant colors and various breeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Tuna:</strong> Fast and migratory, tunas are highly sought after in commercial fisheries due to their size and taste.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="fish-type">
            <h3>Cartilaginous Fish (Chondrichthyes)</h3>
            <p>This group includes sharks, rays, and skates, which possess a skeleton made of cartilage instead of bone.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Great White Shark:</strong> A powerful predator found in coastal waters, known for its formidable size.</li>
                <li><strong>Stingray:</strong> Often resting on the seafloor, stingrays are known for their flat bodies and venomous tail.</li>
                <li><strong>Hammerhead Shark:</strong> Recognizable by their unique head shape, they are social animals often found in schools.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="fish-type">
            <h3>Jawless Fish (Agnatha)</h3>
            <p>The most primitive type of fish, jawless fish lack true jaws and are typically scavengers or parasites.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lamprey:</strong> Eel-like parasites that attach to fish to feed on their blood.</li>
                <li><strong>Hagfish:</strong> Notable for their slime production, hagfish scavenge dead and dying marine animals.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="fish-type">
            <h3>Freshwater Fish</h3>
            <p>These fish are adapted to live in freshwater bodies like rivers, lakes, and ponds.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Catfish:</strong> Bottom feeders known for their whisker-like barbels, they thrive in murky waters.</li>
                <li><strong>Carp:</strong> Hardy and adaptable, carp are often found in lakes and rivers worldwide.</li>
                <li><strong>Rainbow Trout:</strong> Brightly colored and popular with anglers, they are typically found in cold freshwater streams.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="fish-type">
            <h3>Marine Fish</h3>
            <p>These fish inhabit oceans and seas, showcasing a wide variety of adaptations and behaviors.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clownfish:</strong> Famous for their symbiotic relationship with sea anemones, they are popular in aquariums.</li>
                <li><strong>Salmon:</strong> Known for their incredible migratory journeys from the ocean to freshwater to spawn.</li>
                <li><strong>Snapper:</strong> Valued for their culinary qualities, snapper are commonly found in tropical waters.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="fish-type">
            <h3>Deep-Sea Fish</h3>
            <p>Adapted to life in the dark depths of the ocean, these fish often have unique physical traits.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anglerfish:</strong> Known for their bioluminescent lure used to attract prey in dark waters.</li>
                <li><strong>Gulper Eel:</strong> Recognizable for its large mouth, allowing it to swallow prey larger than itself.</li>
                <li><strong>Lanternfish:</strong> Small, abundant fish that play a key role in the deep-sea food web.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Conservation Challenges</h3>
        <p>Many fish species face significant threats due to human activities. Effective conservation strategies are essential to ensure their survival:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sustainable Fishing:</strong> Implementing practices that prevent overfishing and allow fish populations to recover.</li>
            <li><strong>Habitat Protection:</strong> Safeguarding critical habitats like coral reefs and wetlands to maintain biodiversity.</li>
            <li><strong>Pollution Reduction:</strong> Minimizing waste and chemicals that contaminate aquatic ecosystems.</li>
        </ul>
